== Custom Nested Resource URL example

This is just a quick sample I created for this {stackoverflow question} [http://stackoverflow.com/a/8753998/527152]

It shows how to create an independent number system for each user's posts in Ruby on Rails.

ie.

    /users/1/posts/1
    /users/1/posts/2
    /users/2/posts/1
    etc.
